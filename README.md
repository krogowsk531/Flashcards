# Flash Cards

This was a partially built project in which you were to create flash cards for JavaScript fundamentals and run them on the command line. If you did not answer 90% of the answers correctly the program would start again.  Test driven design was a core component of the program.

### Setup Instructions

* Clone the forked repo from GitHub
* Once you have cloned the repo change into the home directory and install the dependencies needed.  Type this into the command line:
```bash
npm install
```
* Run node index.js in the terminal to start the game
```bash
node index.js

* The user will be asked to answer a series of questions related to fundamental topics in JavaScript.  If they do not get 90% of them correct the game will continue to run until that score is achieved.  The user can always use control C to exit the game.
